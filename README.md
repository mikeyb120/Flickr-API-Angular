# Flickr-API-Angular

Coding Experiment with Flickr's API and Angular.js

This is my first attempt at using angular to create a small application. I have been researching and doing tutorials with this framework for a few weeks and have only sandboxed out ideas in CodePen as of now.

Please let me know if there are any errors or best practices I should be using.
